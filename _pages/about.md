I am Anuj Shah. I am in my final semester at IIIT Bangalore.

Currently I am doing a thesis on Language Independent end-to-end Speech Recognition.

I am trying to build an end-to-end system which can recognize multiple languages thus replacing the need for a different system for each language. Such a system can be particularly useful for low resource languages. This system can perform better than language dependent systems because low resource languages can benefit from the acoustic data of high resource languages.

I am interested in the field of Machine Learning and AI in general. I have been a Teaching Assistant for the course Machine Learning at IIIT Bangalore. My other academic interests include Algorithms and Data Structures. 

Previously, I was a Software Developer Intern at Microsoft IDC, Hyderabad where I was a part of the Microsoft Visio team.
