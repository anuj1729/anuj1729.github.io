Hey there, my name is Anuj. I'm a software engineer on the Microsoft To Do team where I work on the backend developing RESTful APIs that are used by clients to power their tasks experiences. I am interested in developing software systems with a focus on clean code and good design. Prior to my full time stint at Microsoft I was also an intern here where I was part of the Microsoft Visio team. 

Besides developing backend systems I also have some experience working with Machine Learning systems. As part of my M.Tech at IIIT Bangalore I specialized in the Data Science domain. For my master's thesis I developed a multilingual ASR (automatic speech recognition) system. This language independent system gives performance very similar to it's corresponding language dependent counterpart. This ASR system is also capable of decoding code-mixed speech despite seeing no such speech during it's training.
